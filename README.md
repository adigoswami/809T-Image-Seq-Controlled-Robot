# 809T-Image-Seq-Controlled-Robot
This project involved building a robot with IMU, SODAR, and other sensors. Then with the help of python, developed an image recognition code that identifies a swipe on a sensor (the sensor generated
images of heatmaps of any touch). Based on these swipes, the robot is controlled such that a forward swipe means move forward. This is a demonstration of the working prototype for the same.
